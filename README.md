### README ###

This is a simple TicTacToe board game. I have upgraded to React 19. this game leverages:


- react 19's formData
- reducers
- contexts (new Provider sytaxes were used)
- Layout components with children ( i found some experts used layout components to seperate data, logic(controller) and UI View  entirely. 

- didnt use React compiler for rerender optimization. but will do it soon.

- tailwind css , disable bootstrap 5 temporarily 

- clsx class name tool
